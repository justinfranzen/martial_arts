                <p class="left">When taught properly, self defense instruction is physically challenging. The way you move when learning or practicing martial arts varies from style to style, but generally the type of exercise is almost identical to interval training. These short, intense bursts of movement and exertion, followed by periods of lower intensity performance are medically proven to be one of the fastest and most effective ways to increase your heart health.</p>

                 <p>Self defense training is intense, very similar to interval training. One of the things that is unique to martial arts is that you get this sort of intense, interval-like training – for thirty to sixty minutes per session. This supercharges your fitness levels as not only to do you condition your short-term performance levels, but you greatly increase your endurance, too. Your body has to adapt to short, intense periods of exercise with brief periods of lower intensity, but done over a long period of time. </p>

                <p class="left">There is a saying in the martial arts about flexibility; “A tree that is unbending is easily broken.”
                    As adults get older, we begin to naturally lose flexibility. If we exercise over the years without working on flexibility our muscles, tendons and ligaments shorten, causing tightness throughout the body. This can lead to problems with balance, range of motion in our joints, pain, lack of mobility and injuries.

                    Unlike other fitness programs, martial arts develops your flexibility as you are training, instead of having separate movements specifically designed to increase your range of motion. Because self defense training teaches you how to protect yourself in various situations using your entire body, your body learns to perform in all directions, on all planes of movement and through full ranges of motion. The more your train, the more fluid and smooth your movements become, like an animal in the wild. Strong, but relaxed and explosive.</p>

               <h3 class="benefit">IMPROVED BALANCE</h3>
        
             <p>Improving your balance happens when you practice going through the full planes of movement – forward, back, side-to-side and rotational. If you don’t practice working on your balance, it will deteriorate. As we age, becoming unsteady on our feet can lead to falls and serious injury – even death. Like we mentioned earlier in the section on flexibility, martial arts training constantly takes you through these planes as a byproduct of performing the techniques. More than one martial artist can tell you how training helped them prevent getting injured when they tripped or stumbled over something and was able to regain balance quickly before falling.</p>

                <p class="left">When you challenge yourself to do something you have never done before – and you do it – not only do you feel better about yourself but you develop mental toughness and focus. This mental toughness is a form of courage; it is the ability to recognize and acknowledge the butterflies in your stomach when you are afraid of something, facing a challenge or doubting yourself – but getting yourself to take action anyway.

                It is knowing you can handle anything that comes your way, no matter what. When you are taking your martial arts class, your mind has to be one hundred percent focused on the task at hand. Because of the physical and mental demands of this kind of training it is almost impossible to think about work, family or anything else. The more you train the stronger your mental focus becomes, making it easier for you to get things done at work and at home.</p>
