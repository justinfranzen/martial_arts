    <p>When taught properly, self defense instruction is physically challenging. The way you move when learning or practicing martial arts varies from style to style, but generally the type of exercise is almost identical to interval training. These short, intense bursts of movement and exertion, followed by periods of lower intensity performance are medically proven to be one of the fastest and most effective ways to increase your heart health.</p>

     <p class="col-lg-8 col-md-8 col-sm-8">Self defense training is intense, very similar to interval training. One of the things that is unique to martial arts is that you get this sort of intense, interval-like training for 30 to 60 minutes per session. This supercharges your fitness levels as not only to do you condition your short-term performance levels, but you greatly increase your endurance, too. Your body has to adapt to short, intense periods of exercise with brief periods of lower intensity, but done over a long period of time.  With your increased endurance comes the ability to stay focused longer, have steady energy throughout your day and no more of those afternoon energy crashes or feelings of exhaustion at the end of a busy day.</p>

     <p>Martial Arts is an art that not only teaches self defense and improves conditioning but it also improves and enhances confidence. By improving your mental outlook on yourself and life by improving yourself overall, your confidence will directly be effected as well. Most people think of fighting when they think of Martial Arts but the reality of it is that it actually focuses more on improving one's self both in the mind and physically. Of course it teaches someone to defend themselves but the personal results are much better on a deeper level of thinking. </p>
