    <p id="form-info">Martial Arts forms are very useful in many ways to enhance and improve techniques.  They are also widley used in competitions are are scored based on accuracy in each movement in the form.  There are several movements, at least 10 or more, to one form.  In addition, they are also useful for improving balance while performing a specific movement.  More importantly, they help make any kind of technique flow more fluidly and efficiently if they are used in a real life self defense action.</p>

         <p id="advance-form">This is a more advanced form not only because it has 25 movements but also because it consists of more detailed movements that basic forms don't have.  It can take up to one or two weeks to learn a form and depending on amount and duraction of practice, it could take longer to perfect the form.  Some types of martial arts require learning forms to advance to the next belt color.  Learning these forms helps with improving techniques and makes them more efficient.</p>
